Dotfiles are the customization files that are used to personalize your Linux or other Unix-based system.
You can tell that a file is a dotfile because the name of the file will begin with a period--a dot! The
period at the beginning of a filename or directory name indicates that it is a hidden file or directory.
This repository contains my personal dotfiles. They are stored here for convenience so that I may quickly
access them on new machines or new installs. Also, others may find some of my configurations helpful in
customizing their own dotfiles.

** Configurations
:PROPERTIES:

:END:
All important configuration files are designed to be managed with Org-mode's tangling feature. Each
configuration is contained in a =README.org= file that automatically tangles to the appropriate config
file when saved.

| Configuration | Description                       | Path                           |
|---------------+-----------------------------------+--------------------------------|
| [[./.config/i3/README.org][i3wm]]          | Tiling window manager             | =.config/i3/README.org=        |
| [[./.config/polybar/README.org][Polybar]]       | Status bar                        | =.config/polybar/README.org=   |
| [[./.config/alacritty/README.org][Alacritty]]     | GPU-accelerated terminal emulator | =.config/alacritty/README.org= |
| [[./.config/fish/README.org][Fish Shell]]    | User-friendly shell               | =.config/fish/README.org=      |

** How To Manage Your Own Dotfiles
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       c6e5d53d-e85e-4e02-9a0d-5c25f8a003f2
:END:
There are a hundred ways to manage your dotfiles. My first suggestion would be to read up on the subject.
A great place to start is "Your unofficial guide to dotfiles on GitHub": https://dotfiles.github.io/

Personally, I use the git bare repository method for managing my dotfiles:

** Org-mode Tangling
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       0b82ec84-cdf5-4b6e-9038-40676a629385
:END:
All configuration files in this repository use Org-mode's literate programming capabilities through
tangling. This approach offers several benefits:

- *Documentation and code together*: Each configuration file includes both the code and detailed
  explanations
- *Organized structure*: Configurations are broken down into logical sections with headings
- *Auto-tangling*: Files are automatically processed when saved (with proper setup)

*** Setting Up Auto-Tangle
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       27863cd5-b90e-41a6-aca8-efa6f49f48fa
:END:
To enable auto-tangling on save, add the following to your Emacs configuration:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; Auto-tangle configuration files
(use-package org
  :config
  (defun org-babel-auto-tangle ()
    "Automatically tangle org files when saved."
    (when (eq major-mode 'org-mode)
      (let ((auto-tangle (cdr (assoc "auto_tangle" (org-collect-keywords '("PROPERTY"))))))
        (when (and auto-tangle (string= auto-tangle "t"))
          (org-babel-tangle)))))
  (add-hook 'after-save-hook #'org-babel-auto-tangle))
#+end_src
